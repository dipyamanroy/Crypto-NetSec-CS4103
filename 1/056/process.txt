The program should first prompt the user for the type of encryption routine (Caesar or Vigenere Cipher or playfair cipher) he wants to use. It should then ask the user if he wants to encrypt or decrypt and also the KEY to be used. The program should read the plaintext/cipher text from a file called process.txt. The file process.txt will have either plaintext/cipher text as the case may be. The file process.txt will be placed in the same folder as your program.
